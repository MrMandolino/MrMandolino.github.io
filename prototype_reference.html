<p>This is a short list of links to games I've published on the web and embedded videos showing some personal prototypes.</p>

<h2>My games</h2>

<p>You can find short games I released on <a href="https://mrmandolino.itch.io/">my personal itch.io page.</a></p>

<h2>My personal prototypes</h2>

<p>Below are videos of prototypes I've made to test out ideas for potential projects, to study games I played, or just for fun.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, all prototypes are in Unreal and all non-store assets are made with Blender.</p>



<p>This is my current personal project, a bullet hell going for PS2-era graphics. This is a test for transitioning between main screen and gameplay. </br>(Godot, using GDScript. All assets made with Blender, music written by me.) </p>

<p>This is a test of the modular bullet pattern system I wrote for the game. The system allows me to pass multiple behaviors to a bullet at spawn time, executed in sequence over set periods of time. </br>(Godot, using GDScript)</p>
