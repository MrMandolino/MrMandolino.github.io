<p>This is a short list of links to games I've published on the web and embedded videos showing some personal prototypes.</p>

<h2>My games</h2>

<p>You can find short games I released on <a href="https://mrmandolino.itch.io/">my personal itch.io page.</a></p>

<h2>My personal prototypes</h2>

<p>Below are videos of prototypes I've made to test out ideas for potential projects, to study games I played, or just for fun.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, prototypes are in Unreal (using Blueprints) and all non-store assets are made with Blender.</p>

<p>A prototype of a cinematic camera system with multiple parameters for camera control. </br>Made for level design prototyping purposes on a collaborative project with other Italian devs, inspired by Inside and Limbo.</p>

<p>This is a prototype of a traversal system using player-spawned plants that propel you forward. </br>The last section of the short sequence shows a grappling hook as well. </br>

<p>This is my current personal project, a bullet hell going for PS2-era graphics. This is a test for transitioning between main screen and gameplay, and masking the camera switching from perspective to orthographic. </br>(Made with Godot, using GDScript. Music written by me.) </p>

<p>This is a test of the modular bullet pattern system I wrote for the game. </p>The system allows to pass multiple behaviors to a bullet at spawn time, executed in sequence over set periods of time. </br>(Godot, using GDScript)</p>

<p>A prototype of a puzzle game where you lead a line of salamanders, a 3D version of a 2D game I released. The cars can be driven. </br> (Made with GameMaker's 3D functionalities.) </p>
